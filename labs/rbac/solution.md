# Lab Solution

## Kube-explorer RBAC

First confirm the app doesn't have access to ServiceAccount objects:

```
kubectl auth can-i get serviceaccounts -n default --as system:serviceaccount:default:kube-explorer
```

This spec contains the new permissions:

- [service-account-viewer.yaml](solution/service-account-viewer.yaml) - a Role with rules to get and list ServiceAccounts, and a RoleBinding applying it to the app's ServiceAccount

> You could also amend the original Role, but that would mean any other principals using that role would also get the new permission.

```
kubectl apply -f labs/rbac/solution/service-account-viewer.yaml

kubectl auth can-i get serviceaccounts -n default --as system:serviceaccount:default:kube-explorer
```

Now the app has the permissions it needs, the _Service Account_ link works, but only for the `default` namespace. You should still get a 403 error if you try to view ServiceAccounts in another namespace.

## Securing the sleep Deployment

First verify the original sleep Pod does have the SA token mounted:

```
kubectl exec deploy/sleep -- cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token
```

The simplest way to fix it is with the `automountServiceAccountToken` field in the Pod spec:

- [sleep-without-sa-token.yaml](solution/sleep-without-sa-token.yaml)


```
kubectl apply -f labs/rbac/solution/sleep-without-sa-token.yaml

kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready pod -l app=sleep,sa-token=none

kubectl exec deploy/sleep -- cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token
```

Every Pod runs in the context of a ServiceAccount - check and you'll see this one uses the `default` SA:

```
kubectl get pod -l app=sleep,sa-token=none -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.serviceAccountName}'
```

A better approach is to use a custom ServiceAccount with `automountServiceAccountToken` set at the SA level.

Any app which doesn't use the API server can use this SA - apps which do use the API server will each have their own SA with the permissions the app needs.

- [sleep-with-no-token-sa.yaml](solution/sleep-with-no-token-sa.yaml) - a new SA and Pod configured to use it
